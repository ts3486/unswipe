# Unmatch — Marketing Plan

## 1. Monetization Model: One-Time Unlock

**Model:** Free to install, pay-to-unlock before using core features.

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| Price | **$6.99 USD** (single payment, lifetime access) |
| Free tier | Onboarding + Day 1 of starter course + 1 panic reset demo |
| Unlock gate | After the first reset demo, show paywall before second use |
| Rationale | One-time purchase removes subscription fatigue, reduces churn, eliminates renewal support burden, and simplifies App Store review (no auto-renewing SKU) |

### Why $6.99
- Low enough for impulse purchase (less than one dating app boost)
- High enough to signal value and filter casual downloaders
- Competitive with similar niche self-help apps (Quitzilla $4.99, I Am Sober free+IAP)
- Can be raised later; harder to lower without upsetting early buyers

### Regional Pricing
Use Apple/Google's auto-generated regional price tiers. Consider a lower tier ($3.99 equivalent) for markets like India, Brazil, Southeast Asia where dating app spending culture differs.

## 2. Positioning & Messaging

### One-Liner
> Take back your time from dating apps.

### Elevator Pitch (App Store subtitle / short description)
> Unmatch helps you break the swipe-check-spend cycle with a 60-second reset when urges hit. No lectures, no blocking, no accounts. Just a calm, private tool that works offline.

### Positioning Matrix

| Competitor | Why Unmatch Wins |
|---|---|
| Screen Time / Digital Wellbeing | Too generic — blocks everything, not tailored to dating app psychology |
| I Am Sober / Quitzilla | Sobriety framing feels too heavy for "I swipe too much" |
| Therapy apps (BetterHelp, etc.) | Overkill, expensive, requires accounts and vulnerability |
| Just deleting the app | Doesn't work — 80%+ reinstall within a week |
| Willpower alone | Unmatch gives a structured 60-second protocol instead |

### Core Value Props (for all marketing copy)
1. **60-second panic reset** — not a 30-day program to start
2. **Works offline, no account** — nothing to leak, nothing to explain
3. **Spend delay cards** — catches impulsive IAP before it happens
4. **Resist Rank** — quiet gamification that builds over time
5. **Stealth notifications** — no one sees "dating app help" on your phone

## 3. Target Audience

### Primary Persona: "The Aware Swiper"
- 22–38, any gender, urban/suburban
- Uses 2–3 dating apps simultaneously
- Checks apps 10–30+ times/day, especially at night
- Has spent money on boosts/super likes and felt regret
- Has tried deleting apps and reinstalled within days
- Knows their usage is a problem but doesn't identify as "addicted"
- Values privacy — would never post about this publicly

### Secondary Persona: "The Spending Regretter"
- Same demo but skews slightly older (28–40)
- Primary pain is financial: $50–200+/month on IAP, dates, gifts
- More likely to convert on a one-time $6.99 (ironic savings pitch)

### Anti-Persona (do not target)
- People happily using dating apps
- People seeking relationship/dating coaching
- Minors
- People in active clinical treatment for behavioral disorders

## 4. Channel Strategy

### 4.1 App Store Optimization (ASO) — Highest ROI, do first

**Keywords (research and bid on these):**
- dating app addiction, stop swiping, dating app detox
- tinder break, hinge addiction, bumble too much
- screen time dating, dating app spending, swipe less
- digital wellbeing dating, phone habit dating

**App Store Category:** Health & Fitness (primary), Lifestyle (secondary)

**Title & Subtitle:**
- iOS: `Unmatch — Break the Swipe Cycle`
- Google Play: `Unmatch: Stop Swiping, Start Living`

**Screenshots (5 required, already have 4):**
1. Home screen showing streak + "Resist" CTA — headline: "60 seconds to reset"
2. Panic flow breathing screen — headline: "Breathe through the urge"
3. Progress calendar with green success days — headline: "Watch your streaks grow"
4. Spend delay card — headline: "Think before you boost"
5. Stealth notification mockup — headline: "No one has to know"

**App Store Description Structure:**
```
Hook line (emotional)
3 bullet features
Social proof / stat (when available)
Privacy reassurance
CTA
```

### 4.2 Reddit — Highest-value organic channel

**Target subreddits (by relevance):**
- r/dating (2M+), r/OnlineDating (200K+), r/Tinder (6M+), r/hingeapp, r/Bumble
- r/nosurf (300K+), r/digitalminimalism (200K+)
- r/selfimprovement (2M+), r/DecidingToBeBetter
- r/personalfinance (when spend angle relevant)

**Approach:**
- Do NOT post ads or app links directly — Reddit will downvote
- Create a genuine account, participate in conversations about dating app fatigue
- Share the concept/approach first, mention the app only when asked
- Post a "I built this" story in r/sideproject, r/indiedev, r/apple
- Comment on "I can't stop swiping" posts with value-first advice, mention app casually
- Create a dedicated r/unmatchapp subreddit for community and feedback

**Content angles that work on Reddit:**
- "I tracked my Tinder usage for 30 days — here's what I found"
- "The psychology of why deleting dating apps doesn't work"
- "I spent $X on Hinge boosts this year. Here's what changed."
- "Dating app companies design for addiction. Here's the playbook."

### 4.3 TikTok / Instagram Reels — Awareness at scale

**Content pillars (short-form video, 15–60s):**

1. **"Did you know" hooks** — dating app manipulation tactics
   - "Tinder sends notifications at 10pm because..."
   - "Hinge's 'Most Compatible' is designed to..."
   - "You spend X hours/year swiping. That's Y full days."

2. **Relatable skits** — exaggerated dating app moments
   - Checking phone under restaurant table
   - Swiping during a work meeting
   - Buying a boost at 2am and regretting it

3. **Calm counter-content** — the breathing exercise, the app UI
   - Screen recordings of the 60-second reset
   - "What I do instead of swiping at night"
   - Streak milestone celebrations

4. **Testimonials** (once users exist)
   - "Week 1 vs Week 4" format
   - Anonymous screen recordings

**Posting cadence:** 3–5 per week across TikTok + Reels. Repurpose to YouTube Shorts.

### 4.4 Content Marketing (SEO blog)

Host a simple blog (Substack or Ghost, free tier). Target long-tail keywords:

| Article | Target Keyword |
|---|---|
| "How to Stop Swiping on Tinder: A Practical Guide" | stop swiping tinder |
| "Dating App Addiction: Signs and What to Do" | dating app addiction |
| "I Spent $500 on Hinge in 3 Months" | hinge spending |
| "The 60-Second Rule for Dating App Urges" | dating app urges |
| "Why Deleting Dating Apps Doesn't Work" | deleting dating apps |
| "Screen Time Limits Don't Work for Dating Apps" | screen time dating apps |

Each article naturally mentions Unmatch as a tool (not a hard sell). Link to App Store from each article.

### 4.5 Podcast Guest Appearances

Pitch yourself to podcasts covering:
- Digital wellness / phone habits
- Modern dating culture
- Personal finance (spend angle)
- Indie app development (builder story)

Talking points: the niche insight, the psychology, the product decisions (offline-first, no account, stealth mode).

### 4.6 Partnerships

- **Therapists / counselors** — offer a free "clinician info sheet" they can share with clients. Not medical claims, just "this tool may help between sessions."
- **Digital wellness influencers** — micro-influencers (5K–50K followers) in the mindfulness / phone detox space. Offer free promo codes.
- **Financial literacy creators** — the spend angle is underserved and compelling.

## 8. Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| "Why pay when I can just delete the app?" | Messaging: "You've tried that. 80% reinstall within a week." |
| App Store rejection (IAP issues) | One-time non-consumable is simpler than subscriptions to review |
| Low conversion at $6.99 | A/B test $4.99 and $3.99; consider free 3-day trial |
| Negative reviews ("doesn't actually block apps") | Preempt in description: "Not a blocker. A reset tool." |
| Copycats | First-mover in niche + community moat + brand > features |
| Content moderation on Reddit/TikTok | Stay genuinely helpful, never astroturf, disclose you're the creator |

## 9. Long-Term Revenue Expansion (Post-V1)

Once the one-time unlock model is validated:

1. **Premium tier** ($2.99/month or $19.99/year) — advanced analytics, extended courses, smart reminders
2. **Couple/friend packs** — buy 2 unlock codes for $9.99 (viral + revenue)
3. **Corporate wellness** — pitch to HR departments as an employee benefit
4. **Anonymized aggregate insights** — "X% of users reduce swiping by 50% in 30 days" (for PR, not sold)
5. **Branded partnerships** — wellness brands, financial apps (non-competing)
